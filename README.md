# Price Predictor is a 

# This machine learning project using python is created to to inderstand how machine learning problems are tackled in real world scenarios. 
# Differnet regression models are tried and the best model is chosen to get best results for our dataset.
# This problem is an example of supervised learning, regression task, batch learning and RMSE type error measurements for the data.
# Whole process is automated in Jupyter Notebook.
# Includes: 
  a) looking for correlations
  b) handling missing data through imputing
  c) understanding scikit-learn designs
  d) creating pipelines
  e) feature scaling
  f) cross-validation of data 
  g) choosing best regression model
  h) saving model 
  i) testing model
  j) launching model.
 
 
 # For this problem, among linear regression, decision tree and random forest, random forest was the best regression model!
 # Libraries used are:
   1) Jupyter notebook
   2) Numpy
   3) MatplotLib
   4) Pandas
   5) Scipy
   6) Scikit-learn (Sklearn)
