This machine learning project using python is created to to understand how machine learning problems are tackled in real world scenarios. 
 Different regression models are tried and the best model is chosen to get best results for our dataset.
 This problem is an example of supervised learning, regression task, batch learning and RMSE type error measurements for the data.
 Whole process is automated in Jupyter Notebook.
# Includes: 
  a) looking for correlations
  b) handling missing data through imputing
  c) understanding scikit-learn designs
  d) creating pipelines
  e) feature scaling using standardisation
  f) cross-validation of data
  g) choosing best regression model
  h) saving model
  i) testing model
  j) launching model.
 
 
  For this problem, among linear regression, decision tree and random forest, random forest was the best regression model!
 # Libraries used are:
   1) Jupyter notebook
   2) Numpy
   3) MatplotLib
   4) Pandas
   5) Scipy
   6) Scikit-learn (Sklearn)
